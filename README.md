### Configuration Management Guidelines

Pursuant to the class's document on [using CM tools](https://course.techconf.org/se4485/Template/CM-Tool.pdf), we must document our changes when writing code or supplemental documents.

**For editing docs**

1. Name the change in the version history tab in google docs
2. add a comment to your changes noting what has changed
3. get two other members to reply to your comments with a review

When pushing major changes of the docs to GitHub:

1. Compile all comments added to the Google doc since the last GitHub push and add them as a changelog to the PR
2. Get two reviewers for the PR (I will add a rule for this)

Once the changes have been pushed to the GitHub, clear all Google doc comments

**For editing code**

Specific guidelines coming TBD.
