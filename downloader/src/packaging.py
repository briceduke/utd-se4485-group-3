    Args:
        files: List of paths to downloaded extension files
        output_dir: Directory where the output files should be saved
        name_template: Template for naming the output files (e.g., 'everfox-extensions-{{date}}.zip')

    Returns:
        Tuple of (zip_path, manifest_path) containing paths to created files

    The name_template may contain the placeholder ``{{date}}`` which will be
    substituted with the current UTC date in YYYYMMDD format. If the
    resulting name does not end with ``.zip`` the suffix will be added.
    A manifest JSON with the same base name and a ``.json`` extension will
    be written alongside the ZIP file. The manifest contains per-file
    metadata including filename, size (bytes) and sha256.
